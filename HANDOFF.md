# Current Handoff — Final Logic Implementation

**Updated:** 2026-10-09
**Checkpoint:** Independent review correction committed and verified; renewed independent review pending

## Active Checkpoint

- **Repository:** `apirak-k/COSTBREAKDOWN`
- **Implementation branch:** `codex/final-logic-implementation`
- **Remote target:** `origin/codex/final-logic-implementation`
- **Worktree:** `.worktrees/codex-final-logic-implementation`
- **Independent review correction base:** `4a1968db841d97ff8d6c44b3aadf929f73e01be1`.
- **Latest application source commit:** `15379d92a2815fa6bea89f2b9cad56ec29347148` (`fix: reset Parameter SIM on RCA handoff`).
- **Full implementation baseline:** `665099b71319ec98c537a0859336dc01b9acc118`.
- **Status:** The complete Frozen Final Requirement Traceability Checklist v1.0 audit and implementation re-audit are recorded in `.planning/2026-10-09-final-logic-implementation/findings.md`. All 475 IDs retain explicit Spec / Code / Test / Status evidence: 473 PASS, 2 N/A — PROVISIONAL/UI ONLY (R-10 and R-11), 0 open FINDING, and 0 NOT VERIFIED after the two latest review corrections. The RCA→Simulation stale-SIM handoff and legacy `rca` tab migration fixes are committed and pass locally; this checkpoint records the correction evidence and awaits independent review. The documentation source branch was not modified. Footer/frontend styling remains deferred until the independent reviewer explicitly says `FINAL LOGIC ALIGNED ✅`.
- **Delivery target:** `codex/final-logic-implementation` → `origin/codex/final-logic-implementation`.

## Frozen Checklist Completion Evidence

- All initially confirmed implementation findings and applicable evidence gaps were addressed. The complete per-ID final matrix is in `findings.md`; the frozen requirement wording and IDs in `task_plan.md` are unchanged.
- The active review fixture and system logic diagram were corrected. Superseded agreement/history documents remain retained and are called out in the audit ledger rather than rewritten as current requirements.
- TypeScript verifiers: 62/62 effective PASS (60 through the cached CJS runner; 2 SSR verifiers through Vite). MJS verifiers: 2/2 PASS.
- `npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false`: PASS. `npm run build`: PASS, 2,028 modules. Active-source superseded-logic scan: PASS. Baseline-to-HEAD review and `git diff --check`: PASS.
- Isolated browser checks covered the Master Data spreadsheet interactions, including Shift/Ctrl row selection, and the RCA/Simulation, Selected Comparison, Economic-only, standalone Simulation, and context lifecycle flows. The original user tab was not modified.

## Independent Review Findings Corrected

This section records the earlier review loop and remains historical implementation evidence. The full frozen checklist audit below supersedes its narrower completion checkpoint; it does not invalidate these individual fixes.

1. **Factors to Simulate are business records.** The selector now lists eligible Material and Process/Routing records. Selecting a record exposes all three applicable BOM or Routing parameter inputs on that record. The calculation still recalculates the full SIM snapshot, and Work Center rates remain excluded. Existing stored parameter-type selections are discarded during state reconciliation.
2. **Economic-only Simulation is independent.** Action Cost and Evaluation Quantity are available before Parameter SIM starts; Required Saving is calculated without a SIM snapshot. Starting Parameter SIM preserves those inputs. Economic Margin is shown only when Parameter Simulation exists, alongside the Parameter Saving result. Action Cost remains outside Standard Cost.
3. **RCA Case can proceed to Simulation.** The active Case ID, Candidate keys, and latest Root Cause/Action draft are carried into Simulation. RCA remains complete without Simulation, and no completion gate is added. For a new SIM after this handoff, Current is the first/default source choice while Reference and Custom stay available. Candidate context does not lock or preselect Factors; all Material and Process records remain selectable.
4. **RCA handoff always starts a fresh Parameter SIM state.** An explicit handoff now clears any pre-existing Current, Reference, or Custom Parameter snapshot, selected Factors, source, fingerprint, and start time rather than reusing them. Reconciled Economic inputs are preserved. The legacy `activeTab='rca'` value now returns to the Candidate/RCA workflow; `dashboard` still maps to Simulation.

## Verification

- All 62 TypeScript verifiers pass effectively; 60 use the cached CJS runner and two SSR verifiers pass through Vite. Both MJS verifiers pass (2/2).
- `npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false` passes. `npm run build` passes with 2,028 modules transformed. The build continues to report ExcelJS browser externalization warnings for `fs`, `crypto`, and `fast-csv`.
- The final A-01 through W-33 matrix contains 475 unique IDs with no missing or duplicate IDs. Status is 473 PASS, 2 N/A (R-10/R-11), 0 FINDING, 0 NOT VERIFIED.
- `git diff --check`, stale/superseded active-source scan, and full baseline-to-HEAD diff review pass.
- Targeted tests cover Master Data lifecycle and all six Clone From directions; workbook formulas/round-trip; CBD identity/status/reconciliation; Selected Comparison lifecycle; candidate ranking; single/multi-Candidate RCA; RCA completion without SIM; RCA→SIM handoff; standalone and three-source Simulation; record-based factors/full-dataset recalculation; Economic-only and combined modes; Action Cost isolation; commercial formulas; state migration and cross-flow context.
- Isolated browser checks confirmed Master Data editing/navigation/paste/bulk actions and Shift/Ctrl row selection; one-/multi-Candidate RCA handoff; Current-first with Reference/Custom available; additional Factor selection; Economic-only inputs before Parameter SIM and their persistence into combined mode; direct Simulation without stale RCA context.
- Phase 16 targeted regressions directly exercise resetting pre-existing Current/Reference/Custom Parameter SIM states before RCA handoff, clearing old Factors, retaining Economic inputs, showing Current first with Reference/Custom available, unrestricted Material/Process Factor selection, RCA-context expiry, and legacy active-tab migration. The exact old-SIM→RCA→Proceed integration was not separately clicked through in a browser during this correction batch.

## Remaining Verification Limits and Build Notes

- Native Excel was not launched; generated workbook formulas, notes, styles, and round-trip behavior were checked by the workbook verifiers. Human visual acceptance remains a later checkpoint and was not represented as complete.
- Phase 16 exercised the handoff state transition and server-rendered controls; no browser click-through of each old-SIM source sequence was performed in this correction batch.
- Vite reports the existing ExcelJS `fs` / `crypto` browser-externalization warnings during build; the production build completes successfully.
- `npm audit --audit-level=high` reports 5 High development-dependency findings and 4 Moderate findings overall. The production-only audit has no High findings but reports 2 Moderate ExcelJS/uuid findings. npm's full automatic remediation proposes breaking dependency changes, so no dependency update was included in the frozen logic scope.
- The worktree contains an unrelated untracked `src/graphify-out/` directory generated by tooling. It was preserved and excluded from commits.

## Finalized Logic Preserved

1. **Master Data:** Reference, Current, and independent Custom workspaces. The active dataset is the destination for Clone From; structural edits stay in Master Data.
2. **Cost Breakdown:** Reference vs Current only. Selected Comparison remains a temporary analysis scope and does not carry into Simulation.
3. **RCA:** One Case can include one or multiple Candidates. Root Cause and Action complete RCA; Simulation is optional. An active Case can pass context into Simulation without locking scope; a new SIM naturally starts from Current, with Reference and Custom still selectable. Existing Master Data notes remain separate.
4. **Simulation:** One independent module starts from Reference, Current, or Custom; its structure is locked and Current vs SIM is the parameter comparison. Factors to Simulate are Material/Process records; selection controls visibility of that record's editable parameters. The six parameter types are BOM Price/Usage/Loss and Routing Manning/Capacity/Yield. The full SIM recalculates; Work Center rates are not editable.
5. **Economics:** Economic-only mode calculates Required Saving from Action Cost / Evaluation Quantity without a Parameter SIM snapshot. Combined mode also shows Parameter Saving and Economic Margin (`Parameter Saving - Required Saving`); results remain advisory and Action Cost does not enter Standard Cost.
6. **Business formulas:** SG&A amount = Selling Price × SG&A%; OP = Selling Price − Standard Cost − SG&A amount. Negative OP remains visible. The Reference → Current → Simulated graph stays active and shows adjacent signed gaps.
7. **Superseded workflows:** Scenario A/B is not mandatory. The dedicated Trial lifecycle and old combined A/B simulation flow are retired; Custom remains a general-purpose workspace.

## Next Step

Wait for the independent ChatGPT reviewer to inspect the pushed branch. If another finding is reported, correct it, verify it, commit and push the correction, and update this handoff. Do not self-issue `FINAL LOGIC ALIGNED ✅` or begin Footer/frontend styling before the exact reviewer approval.
