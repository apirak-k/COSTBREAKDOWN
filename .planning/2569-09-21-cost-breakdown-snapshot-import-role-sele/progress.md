# Progress Log

## Session: 2569-09-21

### Current Status

- **Phase:** 3 - Role Selector Implementation
- **Plan ID:** 2569-09-21-cost-breakdown-snapshot-import-role-sele
- **Started:** 2569-09-21
- **Last update:** Runtime RED evidence captured; bounded UI implementation started.

### Actions Taken

- Read the requested planning-with-files skill and selected implementation, testing, frontend, Git, browser, and verification guidance.
- Initialized the named plan directory under .planning/.
- Recorded the current Git checkpoint and the exact role-selector gap.
- Recorded fresh baseline build, Excel audit, and comprehensive audit evidence from the previous inspection.
- Attempted the existing webapp-testing server helper and native Python Playwright path; this machine exposes only a non-runnable Windows Store Python stub and no py launcher.
- Started the local Vite app and inspected the active Master Data panel in Chrome. The current UI shows `Importing as Current` but exposes no Reference/Current selector.
- Committed the named planning records as `c38bf8b` before the implementation edit.

### Test Results

| Test | Expected | Actual | Status |
|------|----------|--------|--------|
| npx tsc -b --pretty false | Exit 0 | Exit 0 | PASS |
| npm run build | Exit 0 | Exit 0; 1,667 modules | PASS |
| npm run excel | No audit errors | 100% formula shielding; zero errors | PASS |
| node scripts/test_comprehensive_audit.js | All checks pass | 31/31 passed | PASS |
| Existing .ts self-checks under plain Node | Assertions execute | ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION before assertions | BLOCKED |
| Python Playwright runner discovery | Existing helper starts | No usable Python runtime / py launcher | BLOCKED |
| Pre-change browser smoke | Two import-role controls are visible | Only Current copy is visible; no role controls | RED / EXPECTED |

### Errors

| Error | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| TypeScript self-check runner unavailable | Carry into Phase 2; use a different bounded verification path and mark any remaining gap [Unverified]. |
| Python Playwright runner unavailable | Use the available browser automation surface for runtime smoke; do not add a dependency just for the runner. |

### Next Action

Review the frontend-engineer edit, then run browser smoke plus build/type-check gates and record the GREEN evidence before the implementation checkpoint commit.
